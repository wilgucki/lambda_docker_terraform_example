# Simple example of Lambda function running Docker container

This is just a template (or proof of concept if you will) for Lambda function running
Docker container. It contains both function code and terraform configuration.
I'll leave it here, so I won't have to look for an example over and over again.

To keep things as clear as possible, this is not production ready!
